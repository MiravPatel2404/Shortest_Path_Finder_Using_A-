# A* Pathfinding Algorithm with Diagonal Movement  

This project implements the A* (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm with support for diagonal movement using Pygame. The program allows users to set start and end points, place obstacles, and visualize the shortest path between them.  

## Features  
- A* Pathfinding Algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest path between two points.  
- Diagonal movement support, allowing movement in all eight directions.  
- Real-time visualization of the algorithm's progress.  
- Interactive grid where users can place barriers and select start and end points dynamically.  
- Different colors for different path states:  
  - Closed nodes  
  - Open nodes  
  - Optimal path  
  - Newly computed paths  

## Requirements  
Ensure you have Python installed, then install Pygame using the following command:  
```bash
pip install pygame
