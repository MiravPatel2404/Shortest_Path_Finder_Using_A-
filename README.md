# A* Pathfinding Algorithm with Diagonal Movement  

This project implements the A* (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm with support for diagonal movement using **Pygame**. The program allows users to set start and end points, place obstacles, and visualize the shortest path between them.  

## 🔥 Features  
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: Efficiently finds the shortest path between two points.  
- **Diagonal Movement Support**: Allows movement in all 8 directions.  
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the algorithm progress step by step.  
- **Interactive Grid**: Users can place barriers, select start and end points dynamically.  
- **Multiple Path Colors**:  
  - 🔴 Closed nodes  
  - 🟢 Open nodes  
  - 🟣 Optimal path  
  - 🟡 Newly computed paths  

## 🛠️ Requirements  
Ensure you have Python installed, then install Pygame:  
```bash
pip install pygame
